Trattoria book keeping app

Luigi Gepetto, legengary chef of the "Pinochio Trattoria" has been manually keeping track of all of the orders which his staff cook throughout the day. As the restaurant has gained in popularity, Luigi is finding it overwhelmingly difficult to manually book-keep the orders that flow through the restaurant.

Luigi, who recently started gaining fluency in software development realized that it would be possible to design a browser based web app which would allow him and his staff to enter the orders throughout the day rather than keeping track of everything manually.

Luigi is contracting with you to develop a simple web based app, that will allow his staff to do the following:
* Enter different kinds of meals/dishes that his restaurant serves
* Keep track of how many of the above has been served throughout the day
* Keep track of time particular order was placed and then delivered

Above can be accomplished in any Javascript framework - we prefer React/Redux but any will do. It is desirable to persist the data beyond one session of the browser (or in other words to store the data in the database) but not necessary. 

Chef Luigi prefers well tested code to ensure that system can be well mainted - it would be a huge bonus for him if the code provided will be accompanied by test cases, though not a requirement.
